      **FinOps Principles act as a north star, guiding the activities of our FinOps practice.**


      These principles are in no particular order, and they should be taken as a whole. We encourage members to understand and practice all of these principles.

        title: Teams need to collaborate
        text: >
          - Finance, technology, product, and business teams work together in near real time as the cloud operates on a per-resource, per-second basis.

          - Teams work together to continuously improve for efficiency and innovation.

        title: Decisions are driven by business value of cloud
        text: >
          - Unit economic and value-based metrics demonstrate business impact better than aggregate spend.
          
          - Make conscious trade-off decisions among cost, quality, and speed.
          
          - Think of cloud as a driver of innovation.

        title: Everyone takes ownership for their cloud usage
        text: >
          - Accountability of usage and cost is pushed to the edge, with engineers taking ownership of costs from architecture design to ongoing operations.
          
          - Individual feature and product teams are empowered to manage their own usage of cloud against their budget.
          
          - Decentralize the decision making around cost-effective architecture, resource usage, and optimization.
          
          - Technical teams must begin to consider cost as a new efficiency metric from the beginning of the software development lifecycle.

        title: FinOps data should be accessible and timely
        text: >
          - Process and share cost data as soon as it becomes available.
          
          - Real-time visibility autonomously drives better cloud utilization.
          
          - Fast feedback loops result in more efficient behavior.
          
          - Consistent visibility into cloud spend is provided to all levels of the organization.
          
          - Create, monitor, and improve real-time financial forecasting and planning.
          
          - Trending and variance analysis helps explain why costs increased.
          
          - Internal team benchmarking drives best practices and celebrates wins.
          
          - Industry peer-level benchmarking assesses your companyâ€™s performance.

        title: A centralized team drives FinOps
        text: >
          - The central team encourages, evangelizes, and enables best practices in a shared accountability model, much like security, which has a central team yet everyone remains responsible for their portion.
          
          - Executive buy-in for FinOps and its practices and processes is required.
          
          - Rate, commitment, and discount optimization are centralized to take advantage of economies of scale.
          
          - Remove the need for engineers and operations teams to think about rate negotiations, allowing them to stay focused on usage optimization of their own environments.

        title: Take advantage of the variable cost model of the cloud.
        text: >
          - The variable cost model of the cloud should be viewed as an opportunity to deliver more value, not as a risk.
          
          - Embrace just-in-time prediction, planning, and purchasing of capacity.
          
          - Agile iterative planning is preferred over static long-term plans.
          
          - Embrace proactive system design with continuous adjustments in cloud optimization over infrequent reactive cleanups.
